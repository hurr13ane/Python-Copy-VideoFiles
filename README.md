# Product Availability Checker

A python script for web scraping to check if a product exists on a website and create a HTML table with 4 columns: Availability, Product Name, URL, and Timestamp.

# Story 1 - Two Keyboards
I want to purchase a new keyboard and I have to choose between 2 models, but one of them is out of stock. Instead of manually checking whether the product is in stock or not, I can use the **Supply_Status_Checker** program. 

See in the attached video how I did it, step by step.

[![Two Keyboards - Supply Status Checker](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ag0ENIJMYIQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag0ENIJMYIQ)

# Terms used in the table:
- **Availability:** If the product from the urls.txt is in stock or not;
- **Product name:** Extracted from the URL;
- **URL:** Extracted from urls.txt;
- **Timestamp:** The moment when the check was performed;

# How does it work:

- Using your email and password, the program connects to the selected server in order to send emails to the recipient;
- In the "to" field (recipient), you need to add either your own email or the email where you want to receive the output;
- After running the program, if everything goes according to plan (**see below**);
- The program will access each link mentioned in the urls.txt file;
- After accessing each link, you should receive an HTML table via email to the recipient mentioned in the "to" field, containing the columns availability, product name, url, and timestamp;
- The script will generate a HTML table with 4 columns: Availability, Product Name, URL, and Timestamp;

# For the program to work correctly:
- Ensure that you have all the requirements.txt installed. ( pip install -r requirements.txt )
- Make sure that you have selected the correct server in credentials.py by adding your email and password.
- Make sure you have internet connection when running the program.
